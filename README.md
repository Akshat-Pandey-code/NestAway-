Home Rental Website(NestAway) Using HTML ,CSS & JavaScript

This is a home rental website also known as "NestAway" where users can view the details of the homes and rooms that are available for rent in various locations. This website provides the information to the users and the details of room by clicking on book now. Users can also login or signin and can contact for more details.

This is a multipage responsive website i.e. it can be easily viewed on mobile phones, tablets and laptops or desktops. I've used a lot of html tags for the content, css elements and property to design the website perfectly and javascript to provide various instructions.
